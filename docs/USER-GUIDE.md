## Ensure Full Operational Readiness and Expectation Compliance

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Code Review and Audits**
    - Conduct code review sessions.
    - Perform regular code audits to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

2. **Automated Testing**
    - Run unit tests for all components.
        ```sh
        ./scripts/run_tests.sh
        ```
    - Perform static code analysis and lint checks.
        ```sh
        ./scripts/lint_and_format.sh
        ```
    - Conduct security checks and vulnerability scanning.
        ```sh
        ./scripts/security_checks.sh
        ```

3. **Configuration Checks**
    - Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
    - Verify configuration files for Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana.

### 2. Deployment

1. **Initial Deployment**
    - Deploy the necessary smart contracts.
        ```sh
        ./scripts/deploy_contracts.sh
        ```
    - Deploy the monitoring tools setup.
        ```sh
        ./scripts/deploy_monitoring.sh
        ```

2. **Post-Deployment Verification**
    - Verify that all services are up and running without issues.
    - Check the status of the deployed contracts on NEAR blockchain.
    - Confirm that Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana are correctly collecting and displaying metrics.

### 3. Monitoring and Health Checks

1. **Continuous Monitoring**
    - Ensure Prometheus is scraping metrics continuously.
    - Use Grafana dashboards to visualize system health and performance.

2. **Alerting**
    - Configure Alertmanager to send alerts for any anomalies or performance issues.
    - Set up notifications for critical metrics (e.g., CPU load, memory usage, transaction failures).

### 4. Regular Maintenance

1. **Routine Backups**
    - Perform regular backups of smart contracts and configuration files.
        ```sh
        near view your_account_id get_code > backup/bitcell_contract.wasm
        ```

2. **Scheduled Audits**
    - Conduct periodic security audits.
    - Review and analyze transaction logs regularly.

3. **System Updates**
    - Keep dependencies and blockchain libraries updated.
    - Patch any known vulnerabilities as soon as patches are available.

### 5. Troubleshooting and Incident Response

1. **Log Analysis**
    - Review logs to identify and diagnose issues.
    - Use centralized logging solutions for aggregated log access.

2. **Incident Handling**
    - Have an incident response plan in place.
    - Document all incidents and resolutions for future reference.

### 6. Ensuring Performance Compliance

1. **Performance Testing**
    - Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle the expected load.
    - Use near benchmark tools to evaluate transaction throughput and latency.

2. **Performance Metrics**
    - Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) using Grafana dashboards.
    - Set thresholds and alerts for KPIs that deviate from expected ranges.

### 7. User Feedback and Improvement

1. **Feedback Collection**
    - Gather feedback from external users periodically.
    - Implement suggested improvements to enhance user experience.

2. **Iterative Enhancement**
    - Continuously refine and improve the platform based on user feedback and performance data.
    - Ensure documentation is up-to-date with the latest features and instructions.

By implementing these best practices, you will ensure that all components of the BitCell platform are fully operational, meeting expectations, and ready for both internal and external users. Regular monitoring, testing, and maintenance are critical to maintaining system health and performance.
