# AI Backtesting/Backtracking Feature for Bitcell

Implementing an AI Backtesting/Backtracking feature is essential in managing the risks associated with trading strategies within Bitcell. We test and refine our strategies using historical market data, ensuring optimal performance and thorough risk management. Below is the revised structure for integrating this feature with standardized naming conventions for primary keys within our hierarchical structured relational database.

## Revised Relational Database Structure

### Systems `(0)`

Each system represents a unique trading or investment strategy instance that can be in one of several states: build, backtest, apply, or forwardtest.

- **BIT-SYS-ID:** Primary key, unique identifier for each system.
- **Name:** Name of the trading or investment system.
- **Description:** A brief description of what the system aims to achieve.
- **State:** The current state of the system (`build`, `backtest`, `apply`, `forwardtest`).
- **CreatedAt:** Timestamp when the system was first created.
- **UpdatedAt:** Timestamp of the system's last update.

**Possible States:**
1. `build` - The system is being developed.
2. `backtest` - The system is tested against historical data.
3. `apply` - The system's strategies are being implemented in real-world scenarios.
4. `forwardtest` - The system is evaluated with live data but without actual trades.

**Relationships:**
- Has many BIT-STRAT.

### Strategies `(1)`

- **BIT-STRAT-ID:** Primary key, unique identifier for each strategy.
- **BIT-SYS-ID:** Foreign key referencing the parent system.
- **Name:** Strategy name.
- **Description:** Detailed account of the strategy.
- **Type:** Category of strategy (e.g., Momentum, Mean Reversion).
- **CreatedAt:** Timestamp marking the creation of the strategy.
- **UpdatedAt:** Timestamp of the latest strategy modification.

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to a BIT-SYS.
- Has many BIT-SIG.
- Has many Portfolios.

### Signals `(2)`

- **BIT-SIG-ID:** Primary key, unique identifier for each signal.
- **BIT-STRAT-ID:** Foreign key referencing the associated strategy.
- **SignalType:** Type of signal (e.g., Buy, Sell, Hold).
- **TriggerPrice:** Asset price at which the signal triggers.
- **Timestamp:** Date and time the signal was generated.

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to a BIT-STRAT.

### Portfolios `(3)`

- **BIT-PORT-ID:** Primary key, unique identifier for each portfolio.
- **BIT-STRAT-ID:** Foreign key that links the portfolio to its strategy.
- **Name:** Portfolio name.
- **Balance:** Current valuation of the portfolio's assets.
- **CreatedAt:** Creation date and time of the portfolio.
- **UpdatedAt:** Timestamp of the most recent change to the portfolio.

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to a BIT-STRAT.

## Feature Requirements

- Historical Data Analysis: Capabilities to store and analyze extensive historical market data for backtesting.
- Simulation Engine: Evaluate strategy performance against historical data.
- Risk Management Tools: Identify potential losses and compute various risk metrics.
- Reporting Module: Provide detailed reports on backtest outcomes including profitability, drawdowns, and other critical statistics.
- Customization: Allow users to set custom testing parameters for refined analysis.
- Scalability: Facilitate growth in strategy testing without compromising performance.
- Security: Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data across all backtesting phases.

Adopting these standardized naming conventions allows for clear identification and management of different entities within the Bitcell environment, streamlining the process as we develop and optimize our diverse range of trading and investment strategies.

## Automated Backtesting Mechanism

The automated backtesting mechanism within the Bitcell infrastructure is a sophisticated process designed to continually evaluate and optimize trading systems. It leverages the hierarchical database structure, with standardized IDs facilitating clear referencing and retrieval of relevant data, which is key for automating successive iterations. Here's how the structure supports automation.

### Iterative Backtesting Process

With each iteration, the **BIT-SYS** undergoes a complete cycle of backtesting, assessing its performance against a plethora of historical market scenarios. The **BIT-STRAT** linked to the system contain defined rules that trigger **BIT-SIG** when certain market conditions are met. These signals are evaluated against historical price data to determine their efficacy. If improvements are needed, the strategies (BIT-STRAT) are adjusted, and a new backtesting phase commences. This iterative loop continues until the desired level of optimization is achieved.

### Synchronization With Market Conditions

The automated backtesting engine is not static; it is dynamic and responds to changing economic environments. By incorporating real-time financial data feeds into the database, the system synchronizes the **BIT-SYS** parameters to reflect current market trends. Each strategy is periodically reassessed to ensure it stays in sync with the evolving economic landscape, allowing the Bitcell to maintain system relevance and performance.

### Continuous Improvement and Optimization

Each strategy's performance data, captured through its respective **BIT-STRAT**, is scrutinized using advanced analytics. The insights drawn form the basis for refining strategies, tweaking existing algorithms, or developing new ones altogether. Portfolios (BIT-PORT) tied to these strategies directly benefit from such refinements, potentially seeing improved returns. As the system optimizes, the improvements are logged, creating a track record that can be analyzed to fine-tune future iterations further.

### Adaptability and Learning

The key to this automated process lies in its adaptability and learning capabilities. Machine learning algorithms can be incorporated to learn from each iterationâ€™s success and failures, offering increasingly effective optimizations over time. This means that the Bitcell can autonomously adapt its systems to varying market conditions, reducing human error and increasing efficiency.

By leveraging this structured approach, the Bitcell ensures its systems are robust, adaptive, and continuously honed to achieve optimal results. The automated backtesting procedure allows for quick response to inefficiencies, an understanding of risks, and, most importantly, an agile platform capable of weathering the ebbs and flows of the economic environment.
