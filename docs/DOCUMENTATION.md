1. Overview
The BitCell platform is designed for managing and monitoring smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain. It includes several key components and services required for the smooth operation of your platform contracts.

2. Architecture
Components:
Smart Contracts: Core contracts like Nucleus, Vacuole, Lipid Store, and Golgi Apparatus.
Scripts: Deployment scripts, monitoring scripts.
Monitoring Tools: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana.
Interactions:
How the contracts interact with each other and the NEAR blockchain.
Monitoring how the system components work in concert.
3. Setup and Installation
Pre-requisites
Linux environment.
NEAR CLI installed (npm install -g near-cli).
Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana installed.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcell.git
cd bitcell
Install dependencies:

npm install
Configure environment variables:

Create 
 file in the root directory and populate it with necessary variables.
Compile Smart Contracts:

./scripts/compile_contracts.sh
4. Deployment
Deployment Script
Deployment Steps:
Ensure all checks pass before deployment:

./scripts/run_tests.sh
./scripts/lint_and_format.sh
./scripts/security_checks.sh
Deploy to the production environment:

./scripts/deploy_to_prod.sh
5. Monitoring and Alerts
Prometheus Configuration:

, monitoring system metrics via Node Exporter.
NEAR Transaction Monitoring Script:

Alertmanager Configuration:

6. Usage
Interfacing with Smart Contracts
Example NEAR CLI Commands:

Initialize a Contract:

near call your_account_id new '{"nucleus_contract": "nucleus_account_id", "vacuole_contract": "vacuole_account_id", "lipid_store_contract": "lipid_store_account_id", "golgi_apparatus_contract": "golgi_apparatus_account_id", "reinvest_percentage": 10}' --accountId your_account_id
View Transactions:

near view your_account_id get_transactions
7. Backup and Restore
Backup:

Fetch existing contracts:
near view your_account_id get_code > backup/bitcell_contract.wasm
Restore:

Deploy the backup contract:
near deploy --wasmFile backup/bitcell_contract.wasm --accountId your_account_id
8. Security
Regularly perform code audits.
Ensure all access points are secured using best practices.
Keep sensitive information encrypted and secure environment variables properly.
9. Troubleshooting
Deployment Issues:

Check logs for error messages.
Ensure network connectivity.
Performance Issues:

Monitor using Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
Optimize contract code.
Transaction Failures:

Analyze recent transaction logs.
Implement retries and error-handling mechanisms.
10. Contributing
