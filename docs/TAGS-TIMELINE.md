**Version Tag: `v1.0.0-launch`**

All version tags follow semantic versioning principles and may have additional patch versions (e.g., `v0.2.1`, `v0.2.2`) based on bug fixes made between the major milestones. The `v1.0.0` tag signifies the official release of the Bitcell platform ready for public use. Remember that tags should be created in the version control system at every milestone to mark the progress and allow for better management of the codebase.
