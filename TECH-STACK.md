Based on the new requirement to use Chainlink (LINK) instead of Ethereum for the blockchain in the Bitcell project, here is the revised tech stack:

Frontend:

React.js: Use React.js for building the user interface due to its component-based architecture, which is scalable and maintainable for complex applications like Bitcell.

Redux: Implement Redux for state management, especially when dealing with financial data that requires efficient state handling and data flow.

Backend:

Rust with NEAR Protocol: Integrate Rust programming language with NEAR Protocol for building smart contracts that run on the NEAR blockchain. Rust's performance and safety features make it well-suited for developing secure and efficient smart contracts for managing financial operations.

Database:

Chainlink (LINK) Oracle: Utilize Chainlink as the oracle service to securely connect the smart contracts running on the NEAR blockchain to external data sources, enabling the retrieval of off-chain data for on-chain transactions and operations.

Additional Tools:

Git: Utilize Git for version control to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of code revisions.

GitHub: Host the code repository on GitHub for streamlined collaboration, issue tracking, and continuous integration/deployment pipelines for the frontend codebase.

This revised tech stack integrates Chainlink (LINK) as an oracle service to facilitate the interaction between the smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain and external data sources, providing secure and reliable off-chain data for on-chain financial operations. React.js and Rust with NEAR Protocol continue to drive the frontend and backend development for a robust financial platform.

Please let me know if there are any specific requirements or further adjustments needed to better align the tech stack with the project's goals.
