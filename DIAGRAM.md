# Complex Component Diagram with Security & Permissions for the BitCell Platform v0.1.0

Overview:

In this enhanced version of the component diagram, we incorporate additional layers to represent security and permissions control mechanisms within the BitCell platform. This allows for a comprehensive visualization of how security measures and access controls are integrated into the system architecture.

Components:

Frontend Components:

React Components

Redux Store

API Integration Layer

Backend Components:

NEAR Smart Contracts

NEAR Blockchain

Chainlink Oracle Integration

Database Components:

Chainlink Oracle

NEAR Blockchain

Infrastructure Components:

Development Environment

Deployment Environment

Security & Permissions Layers:

Authentication Module

Authorization Module

Encryption Layer

Detailed Relationships and Processes with Security Layers:

User Interaction Flow with Security:

Users log in through the authentication module to access the platform.

Authorization module enforces permissions based on user roles and access rights.

Backend Security Measures:

NEAR Smart Contracts implement access control logic for secure financial operations.

Encryption layer ensures sensitive data is encrypted before storage on the NEAR blockchain.
