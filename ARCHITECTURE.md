# Designing the Initial Architecture of the BitCell Platform v0.1.0

## Components of the BitCell Platform

Frontend Components:

React Components: Responsible for rendering the user interface components and managing interactions with the users.

Redux Store: Manages the application's state, especially for financial data and user transactions.

API Integration Layer: Connects the frontend to the backend services for data retrieval and updates.

Backend Components:

NEAR Smart Contracts: Implemented in Rust to manage financial operations and interactions with the blockchain.

NEAR Blockchain: Stores the immutable ledger of transactions and financial data in a decentralized manner.

Chainlink Oracle Integration: Facilitates secure data retrieval from external sources for on-chain operations.

Database Components:

Chainlink Oracle: Acts as the intermediary between the smart contracts and external data sources, ensuring integrity and reliability for off-chain data.

NEAR Blockchain: Stores transactional and financial data securely on a public blockchain network.

Infrastructure Components:

Development Environment: Includes IDEs, version control tools, and testing frameworks for development and deployment.

Deployment Environment: Configured for hosting the frontend, backend, and blockchain components securely and efficiently.

Flow of Operations:

User Interaction:

Users interact with the React frontend to perform financial transactions and manage their assets.

The frontend communicates with the backend services through APIs to fetch and update data.

Backend Processing:

NEAR smart contracts handle financial operations securely on the NEAR blockchain.

Chainlink oracle integration facilitates data retrieval for on-chain operations, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Data Storage and Security:

Financial data is stored securely on the NEAR blockchain, utilizing the immutability and decentralized nature of blockchain technology.

External data sources are accessed through the Chainlink oracle service, enhancing the integrity of off-chain data integration.
